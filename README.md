When measuring points:

  Your measurement device is considered to be at point (0,0,0) in its own coordinate system

  This is your reference point for all measurements


  When you measure a point, you get three coordinates:

  X: How far left (negative) or right (positive) from the device
  Y: How far forward (positive) or backward (negative) from the device
  Z: How far up (positive) or down (negative) from the device

To use this system effectively:

  Mount or hold your measurement device in a stable position
  This position becomes (0,0,0) in the device coordinate system
  Measure three points on the floor:
  
  Try to make a triangle shape (not in a straight line)
  The Z coordinates should be similar (they're all on the floor)
  
  
  The program will calculate the device height above the floor
